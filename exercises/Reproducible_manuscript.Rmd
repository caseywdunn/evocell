#Reproducible manuscript in R {-}

This is an example of a fully executable, reproducible manuscript in R. Adapted from https://github.com/yihui/knitr-examples/blob/master/001-minimal.Rmd .

## Code chunks {-}

Use three backticks to specify a code chunk

```{r}
1+1
2+3
```

## Graphics {-}

```{r}
plot(1:10)
hist(rnorm(1000))
```

## External image files {-}

![You can even add figures that you generated elsewhere, or the Evocell logo](Logo_Evocell.jpg)

## inline code {-}

Yes I know the value of pi is `r pi`, and 2 times pi is `r 2*pi`.

## math {-}

Sigh. You cannot live without math equations. OK, here we go: $\alpha+\beta=\gamma$. Note this is not supported by native markdown. You probably want to try RStudio, or at least the R package **markdown**, or the function `knitr::knit2html()`.

## nested code chunks {-}

You can write code within other elements, e.g. a list

1. foo is good
    ```{r}
    strsplit('hello indented world', ' ')[[1]]
    ```
2. bar is better

Or inside blockquotes:

> Here is a quote, followed by a code chunk:
>
> ```{r}
> x = 1:10
> rev(x^2)
> ```

## conclusion {-}

Nothing fancy. You are ready to go. When you become picky, go to the [knitr website](http://yihui.name/knitr/).
